# Skillset
A collection of documents and maybe codes to describe my IT skill set and knowledge structure...

This is a planned and designed skill and knowledge sets structure for me or someone else if any in order to proficiently take any designated IT jobs and deal with any type of interviews for those jobs.

Based on this goal and my current experiences and skill sets, I personalized the following skills and knowledge based on my personal experiences and needs.

In pursuing the following career goals, this structure will be the guide for me to develop and grow my knowledge and skills. Therefore, this so called skill and knowledge set is supposed to be subject to changes over time as things change so much in this day.

Probably the final goal for me by this set is to compile a set of technical documents that summarize some technical knowledges or tricks for each technical topics, e.g. Python, Bash, Javascript, C or some interesting stuff. This way, whenever I need to refresh my memory or lookup something, I won't waste my time to look for them somewhere or googling or reading books or docs again and again. Based on my experience, 80% of time were wasted to read those technical documents, especially you just need to refresh your memory. Hopefully, I figure out a efficient or a better way on how to accumulate my knowledge and skills by compiling some documents. At least, I have highly expetaction that this will save a lot of time for myself.
