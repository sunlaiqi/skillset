# Instrumentation

In the context of computer programming, instrumentation refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, to diagnose errors, and to write trace information. Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code instructions that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool. Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

In programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate:

- **Profiling** - a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input. This is useful for properties of a program that cannot be analyzed statically with sufficient precision, such as alias analysis.
- **Performance counters** - components that allow the tracking of the performance of the application.
- **Computer data logging** - components that allow the logging and tracking of major events in the execution of the application.

# Profiling


In software engineering, profiling ("program profiling", "software profiling") is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization
