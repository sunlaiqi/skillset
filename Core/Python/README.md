Summary for Python skill and knowledge 

Maybe the focus of this doc should be on the knowledge that should be known to the developers but often times are ignored or never being known at all. But these knowledge in fact are so critical that they decide if a developer is an expert on Python programming.
It is not fair to say that these are corner knowledge because if a developer lacks such knowledge, it is hard to say he/she is an expert on Python. In this sense, those knowledge or skills are actually key or cirtical for someone to be proficient or be expert at Pythong programming.

The basic process to write this guide is like this:
1. Read all kinds of materials regarding Python
2. Make notes while reading, most of the time, just copy/paste.
3. Compile or edit these raw materials extracted from reading, including summarizing, rephrazing or even creating.
4. Format the contents.
