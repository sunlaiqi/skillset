# Linked List

## Definition

The first node is referred to as the `head` and the last node is referred to as the `tail`; the tailâ€™s next field is `None`.

Singly linked list and doubly linked list

The key differences are that inserting and deleting elements in a linked list has time complexity *O(1)*. On the other hand, obtaining the `kth` element in a list is expensive, having *O(n)* time complexity.
