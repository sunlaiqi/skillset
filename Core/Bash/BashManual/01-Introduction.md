## 1.1 What is Bash?

Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the gnu operating system.

## 1.2 What is a shell?

At its base, a shell is simply a **macro processor** that executes commands. The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.

A shell allows execution of gnu commands, both synchronously and asynchronously.

Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing function- ality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, `cd`, `break`, `continue`, and `exec` cannot be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The `history`, `getopts`, `kill`, or `pwd` builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands.
